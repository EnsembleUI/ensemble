# Ensemble

Welcome to the Ensemble! This repository houses the Flutter runtime, various modules, and an example app called the Starter App that utilizes different packages. Ensemble allows you to build, publish, and iterate native and web apps seamlessly within your browser.

## What is Ensemble?

Ensemble is a revolutionary platform that enables app development through a declarative language. Rather than traditional coding, you configure your app using this language, allowing for rapid development and deployment. Key features of Ensemble include:

- **Native Experience:** Ensemble apps are native to each platform - iOS, Android, and web.
- **Instant Updates:** App definitions are pushed to clients, enabling instant updates without waiting for app store approvals.
- **Cutting-Edge Technologies:** Ensemble apps leverage the latest front-end technologies, such as Flutter for iOS and Android, and React for web, ensuring you're always at the forefront without worrying about technical debt.

- **Auth Module:** Handles authentication functionalities.
- **Bracket Module:** Manages brackets for various purposes.
- **Camera Module:** Provides camera-related features.
- **Connect Module:** Facilitates connectivity features.
- **Contacts Module:** Manages contact information.
- **Deeplink Module:** Handles deep linking functionalities.
- **File Manager Module:** Manages files within the app.
- **Firebase Analytics Module:** Integrates Firebase analytics into Ensemble apps.
