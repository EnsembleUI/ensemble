# Remote execution acceptance ledger

Statuses: `implemented` | `verified` | `blocked` | `unverified`.

**Production-ready:** NO (requires verified Android and iOS cloud E2E + artifact rows).

| Criterion | Android | iOS | Shared |
|-----------|---------|-----|--------|
| Packaging builds | implemented | implemented | |
| Artifact export E2E (pass) | unverified | unverified | |
| Artifact export E2E (fail) | unverified | unverified | |
| Real FTL execution + collect | unverified | unverified | |
| Envelope complete after cleanup | | | implemented |
| Multi-device orchestrate + durable resume | | | implemented |
| Unified reports + correct exit codes | | | implemented |
| Widget/local integration backward compatible | | | implemented |

## Notes

- **Packaging builds (android):** `AndroidFtlPackager` builds APK/androidTest or emits stubs when SDK missing.
- **Packaging builds (ios):** `IosFtlPackager` follows Flutter FTL flow (build ios + xcodebuild build-for-testing + zip); stub packages refused before submit; cloud unverified.
- **Artifact export E2E:** Local `ArtifactExportProof` covers pass/fail envelopes; FTL collection paths remain hypotheses until real device collect.
- **Real FTL execution + collect:** Requires `ENSEMBLE_TEST_FTL_PROJECT_ID` + ADC. Missing creds ⇒ **unverified**, not passed. Blocks multi-device orchestration until Android is verified.
- **Envelope complete after cleanup:** Entry emits `RemoteRunEnvelope` only after `restorePreSuiteStorageAtSuiteEnd`; `cleanupErrors` included.
- **Durable resume:** `RemoteOrchestrator` + `FileRemoteRunStore` + `GcsRemoteRunStore` CAS. GHA artifacts are checkpoints only.
- **Reports:** `RemoteReportReconciler` taxonomy: pass / testFailure / incomplete / infrastructureFailure / artifactFailure.
